            <h2>Skillset</h2>
            <p>With skills in over 4 different fields of design, I am the perfect person to hire when it comes to a full fledged project. Whatever your needs are, I can pretty much take on any challenge.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Product Design</h3>
                    <p>Working at Facebook has taught me a lot about how to understand users, solve problems and build great products.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Visual Design</h3>
                    <p>My experience at dribbble has helped me learn to develop the eye for design. Colors, typography, layout and the whole package.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Motion Design</h3>
                    <p>I started my design journey with motion design in my college days. Motion is something that really fascinates me because of the flexibility of story telling. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Photography</h3>
                    <p>Clicking pictures really brings out the creative in me. Phtography really makes you look and percieve things in a different way.</p>
